Im KuhakuNeko, i can make music, program, and draw.

I made my first video game when i was 14, an endless runner called "Unity-Chan Endless Runner", were most of the assets (music/graphics/code) were made by me.
Since then i started working on other side projects but are still on the making since i need to learn more.
As i was growing, it took intrest to AI and im working on this too.

The reason behind all my works is to help other people through technology.
